# leetcode (or similar)

Realizing my leetcode / coding interview muscles were weaker than they used to be, I started a journey of solving a bunch of leetcode questions. I'm doing everything in typescript with comments and performance analysis as much as possible.

## Running Tetss

```
# run all
pnpm install
pnpm jest


# run specific test
pnpm install
pnpm jest src/__tests__/problem-test.ts
# or

# run in watch mode
pnpm jest --watch src/__tests__/problem-test.ts
```
