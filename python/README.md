# leetcode (or similar)

Realizing my leetcode / coding interview muscles were weaker than they used to be, I started a journey of solving a bunch of leetcode questions. At first I started with typescript, but then realized I should branch out and started working with python too.

## Running Tetss

```
# run all
pytest

# run specific test
pytest src/problem.py

# run in watch mode
pytest-watch
```
